MCP Client Integration:
You'll need an MCP client (written using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client) to interact with your server.
The client will:
Connect to the server.
Send resource requests (e.g., client.readResource("appointy://ui/login-modern")).
Send tool calls (if you implemented tools).
Receive the UI and backend code.
Pass the received code to the LLM for code generation.
LLM Integration:
The core of your system is the LLM.
The LLM will:
Receive the UI and backend code from the MCP client.
Use prompts to guide the code generation process (e.g., "Combine this login form with this authentication backend").
Generate the final application code.
Challenges and Considerations

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling in the server. If a component is not found, return an error to the client. The isError: true flag is important for the LLM to understand that the request failed.
Security: If you're exposing this server over HTTP, consider security measures like authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access to your code templates.
Scalability: For high-traffic scenarios, consider caching the code templates in memory to reduce file system access.
Version Control: Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your AppointySaastak library.
Testing: Write unit tests for your server and client to ensure they are working correctly. Test with various UI components and error scenarios.
Dynamic Templates: Consider how you'll handle dynamic templates that require user-specific data. You might need to implement tools to populate these templates before sending them to the LLM.
Content Types: Carefully define the type field in your resource's contents. This will help the LLM understand the format of each code snippet. Use standard MIME types (e.g., text/html, text/javascript, text/css).
LLM Context Window: Be mindful of the LLM's context window. Large code templates can exceed the context limit. Consider strategies for breaking down the templates into smaller chunks or using techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Next Steps

Set up your AppointySaastak library with a few example UI components (e.g., a simple login form).
Implement the MCP server with the ui-template resource.
Test the server using a simple MCP client (you can write a minimal client just to test the server's resource endpoint). Verify that you can retrieve the UI code from the library.
Integrate with your LLM. Write prompts that guide the LLM to generate code using the retrieved UI components.
Iterate and refine. Add more UI components to your library, implement tools as needed, and improve the LLM prompts to achieve the desired code generation results.
